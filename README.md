# Kirby Inline Footnotes

This very basic plugin borrows the functionality of [@sylvainjule](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-footnotes) and extends Kirby 3 and 4 with inline footnotes.

## 1. Installation

Download and copy this repository to `/site/plugins/inline-footnotes`

## 2. Basic usage

Use the footnotes method on your field: `$page->text()->inlinefootnotes()` or `$page->text()->ifn()` (no need to call `->kirbytext()` before or after, this method will take care of it).

Adding footnotes to your Kirbytext field is simple. Just type them inline in your post in square brackets like this:

```
[^This is a footnote.]
[^ This is another.]
```

Each footnote must start with a caret (`^`) and will be numbered automatically.
